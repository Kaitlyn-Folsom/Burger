# Eat Da Burger!

### A restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
